## Problem
The prevalence of obesity has reached alarming levels globally, with significant health implications, such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and other chronic conditions.<sup>1</sup>,<sup>2</sup> In countries such as Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, the burden of obesity is particularly concerning, necessitating effective interventions for prevention and management.<sup>3</sup> Traditional methods for estimating obesity levels rely on subjective assessments and may lack accuracy. Therefore, there is a pressing need for robust predictive models that can accurately estimate obesity levels based on individual characteristics, including eating habits and physical condition.<sup>4</sup>,<sup>5</sup> To comprehend the multifaceted nature of obesity and its determinants, we analyzed existing research and literature on obesity and its determinants enabling us to identify trends, knowledge gaps, and potential avenues for exploration in our predictive modeling efforts. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aimed to develop predictive models that can effectively estimate obesity levels in individuals in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia based on demographic characteristics and lifestyle behaviors.

## Data
The Estimation of Obesity Levels Based On Eating Habits and Physical Condition dataset obtained from the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository was utilized for the present analysis.<sup>6</sup> The dataset consists of 2111 entries and 17 features, encompassing a range of variables including age, weight, height, eating habits, and physical condition indicators. Underweight and normal obesity categories were collapsed, and overweight and obese categories were collapsed to create a binary outcome. To handle imputed data for categorical predictor variables, the original dataset was manipulated to create three new datasets. In the first dataset (n = 2,111), imputed values were rounded to the nearest whole number (rounded full). In the second dataset (n = 531), imputed values were entirely removed (removed). The third dataset (n = 531) comprised randomly selected data sampled from the rounded dataset (rounded subset).

## Approach
We employed supervised machine learning techniques and algorithms in order to analyze the dataset. Preprocessing techniques and methods were utilized, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. The dataset was split into training (80%) and test data (20%). The inclusion of different features in each model was based on regularization/shrinkage using 5-fold CV. Classification algorithms were explored, including logistic regression, and decision trees, given that our outcome is categorical. These algorithms were selected a priori based on data structure and aim of the present analysis. Models were trained on the training dataset. Hyperparameters were chosen for the selected models. A threshold of 0.5 was set for logistic regression. The size of the decision tree was determined by plotting the deviance against the number of nodes.

## Evaluation
The performance of each trained model was evaluated on the testing dataset. Performance metrics such as testing and training errors, confusion matrix (accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity), and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC-AUC) were calculated. Based on these criteria the best performing model was selected. These metrics collectively provide a comprehensive assessment of each model's performance, enabling us to determine which model performs more effectively in our study. 

Additionally, we will compare training and testing errors to assess the models' generalization ability and identify potential overfitting or underfitting issues. To ensure model stability and robustness, 5-fold cross-validation was employed to estimate misclassification errors. This approach allowed us to evaluate how accurately each model generalizes to unseen data and provides a more reliable estimation of their predictive performance.

## Project Update & Results
### Changes
In the original project proposal, we utilized one dataset (the full dataset), but given the imputed values we created three new datasets. Additionally, we had planned to perform multinomial logistic regression given that our outcome variable contained seven categories. However, for feasibility and the examination of the AUCROC we opted to create a binary outcome variable and employ logistic regression.

### Results
Using 5-fold Lasso regularization, each dataset had features selected, resulting in different combinations of 10 out of the 16 predictors. Across all three dataset types, logistic regression consistently achieved higher AUC values compared to the decision tree algorithm. Specifically, logistic regression yielded AUC values of 0.9049 (rounded full), 0.9194 (rounded subset), and 0.7844 (removed). The decision tree algorithm demonstrated competitive AUC values, slightly lower than logistic regression. The rounded subset consistently outperformed the rounded full and removed datasets, indicating its contribution to better discrimination ability. While the rounded full dataset demonstrated similar performance, logistic regression achieved an AUC of 0.9049, slightly lower than the rounded subset.

Confusion matrix analysis findings provided insights into the logistic regression model's accuracy across datasets. In the rounded full dataset, the model achieved an accuracy of 87.9%, with high sensitivity (94.9%) and moderate specificity (67.3%). Similarly, the rounded subset exhibited an accuracy of 86% with a robust sensitivity (95.6%), but lower specificity (69.2%). Additionally, the removed dataset showed an accuracy of 73.8% with poor sensitivity (54.1%) and high specificity (84.3%). Although these findings complemented the AUC values, the rounded full data revealed higher accuracy than the rounded subset. Misclassification errors were calculated to assess the model's performance, with lower misclassification errors indicating better performance. The rounded subset data yielded the lowest error, followed closely by the rounded full dataset.

## Next Steps
While the manipulation of imputed data provided valuable insights, using a more comprehensive dataset with complete and well-defined data would likely improve the accuracy and robustness of the models. Exploring ensemble methods or neural networks as next steps can enhance the project's predictive accuracy, given obesity’s multifaceted nature. These methods offer stronger performance compared to individual models and effectively capture non-linear relationships. Additionally, retaining the outcome variable in its initial seven categories rather than collapsing it into binary groups may provide a more interpretable representation of the data.
